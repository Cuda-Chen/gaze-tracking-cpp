# gaze-tracking-cpp
A C++ reimplementation of GazeTracking package.

## Why Create This Project?
While I was searching easy-to-use gaze tracking packages, I found
[antoinelame](https://github.com/antoinelame) Python implementation.
However, due to the limitation of my project, I have to use C++.
After scaning the source code, I thought I can give it a shot
to re-implemente this package into C++, and that's the all stories.

## Dependencies
- Dlib
- OpenCV

## How to Use It
This project is header-only, so just copy all the `hpp` files and
you are on the go!

## TO-DO
- [ ] add example usage
- [ ] add more features mentioned in `GazeTracking` pacakge

## Special Thanks
Thanks [GazeTracking](https://github.com/antoinelame/GazeTracking)
give me a good start.
